# Formal Methods for Computer Science

This repository contains a collection of exercises and projects related to formal methods in computer science. Developed during the *Formal Methods for Computer Science* course at the **Department of Computer Science, University of Bari "Aldo Moro"**, under the supervision of dr. [**Berardina Nadja De Carolis**](https://uniba-it.academia.edu/NadjadeCarolis), these materials explore various formal methods and their applications.

## Exercises and Projects

The repository is organized into several exercises, each focusing on different formal methods:

- **Exercise 1: Finite State Machines (FSM) for Non-Player Characters (NPC)**  
  - Design and implementation of FSMs to model NPC behaviors in gaming applications.

- **Exercise 2: Finite State Machines (FSM) for Non-Player Characters (NPC) with LLMs**  
  - Integration and simulation of the modeled NPC behaviors using Large Language Model as agent.

- **Exercise 3: ITEMIS ATM**  
  - Modeling and analysis of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) system using ITEMIS, focusing on statecharts and system transitions.

- **Exercise 4: NuSMV Elevator**  
  - Verification of an elevator control system using the NuSMV model checker, emphasizing temporal logic specifications (LTL properties).

- **Exercise 5: Process Mining - Loan Application**  
  - Application of process mining techniques to analyze and optimize a loan application process, employing PM4Py and LLMs to improve the quality of the discovered process model.
